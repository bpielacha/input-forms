# Description:
Homework project to learn and test different input forms.
# Notes:
- Task aimed more towards looking into various input types and their behavior rather than styling.
- Some simple input boxes styling was performed (e.g. `number` inputs), just for sake of time.
# Conlcusions:
- Styling non-text input types (like `number`, `range`, `checkboxes`, etc.) may is tricky and may require JS.

# Todo:
- [ ] Create different types of inputs and post with `action="http://dev.cotenfrontend.pl"`
- [ ] Test input validation and data types that are being sent
